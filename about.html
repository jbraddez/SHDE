            <p class="text">SHDE (pronounced SHADE) is a growing Pop-Rap Artist based in Teeside whose music style has the likes of The Kid LAROI, Juice WRLD and more. His true interest in creating music began in 2019 after making diss tracks with his friends as a joke. However seeing these tracks actually generate attention, he became more and more interested in taking it seriously. He has performed live many times in different venues acrosss the North East and has collaborated with artists across the globe. </p>

            <p class="text">I CALL is a fan favourite SHDE song about being ignored in a relationship, but seeing both sides in hope that the other side is okay, despite what is going in right now. It showcases the significance of needing your supposed “significant other”, by calling them, while yet receiving no answer. The thought of them being your whole heart, and they decide to not answer when you need them the most, really sets in stone the pathway of the relationship.</p>
